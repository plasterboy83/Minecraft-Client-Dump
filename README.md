# Minecraft-Client-Dump
Im gonna build gopro336's minecraft clients and dump them here if anyone is too lazy to build them themselves (or cant get an oracle account)
<h2>GO TO THE <a href="https://github.com/plasterboy83/Minecraft-Client-Dump/tree/master">MASTER BRANCH FOR</a> THE CLIENTS</h2>
<b>
These are all built from gopro336's github, so they are safe.
